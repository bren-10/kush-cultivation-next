        `Humidity domes help improve germination rates of your seeds. 
        Most seeds,  require moisture and warm temperatures to germinate. 
        Essentially an inexpensive plastic cover, a humidity dome, 
        helps maintain ideal humidity and temperature levels in the tray to maximize seed germination. 
        This clear dome allows light to pass through while trapping heat and moisture inside for quick germination. 
        Applying heat to the bottom of a flat as the seeds germinate will increase your success and 
        ensure a healthy root system.  Should you wish to add heat, purchase the heating pad.`

        `Eazyplug Pyramid and Block Air pruning. EazyPlug: 100% success rate. 
        EazyPlug has, with its organic materials and our special way of bonding, 
        a predetermined pH and EC value and a fixed air-to-water ratio. The EazyPlug is very easy to use. 
        Just make sure that the plug always can drain the excess water and you cannot overwater it. 
        Because the growing conditions are always optimal, 
        the EazyPlug creates a very fast and powerful rooting and germination.`,

        Denature after cultivation
        Plug contains cutting stem and callus and can, in potency, contain a
        regenerative capacity and needs to be denatured by either a strong
        acid or base, concentrated inorganic salts, organic solvents (alcohol
        or chloroform), radiation or heat.

        How to strike cuttings with Eazy Plug
        Step 1: Moisten the Eazy Plug
        Allow the Eazy Plugs to fully suck up water with a pH of 5.8.
        Let it drain out excess water. Do not squeeze out or dry the plugs. Eazy Plugs are self-regulating and will only hold the water they need for an optimum moisture level and an optimum air-to-water ratio. 
        The plug will feel much heavier than Rock-Wool, but that’s normal.
        
        Step 2: Take cutting 
        For a more detailed explanation of taking cuttings click here.
        Cut diagonally at a 45 degree angle just below a node or stem swelling, making sure to keep at least 3 nodes above your intersection.
        Remove all but a couple of leaves. Scrape a little of the outer layer at the bottom of the cutting, but not all around. Cut off ⅓ of the top of remaining big leaves.
        
        Step 3: Root stimulator
        If you want to make use of a rooting powder (for example Rhizopon), dip the base of your fresh cut cutting into the rooting powder.
        
        Step 4: Insertion in Eazy Plug
        Insert the cutting into the Eazy Plug cutting hole. Make sure to insert it deeply enough, completely to the bottom of the cutting hole.
        
        Step 5: Put into propagator
        Put the tray with Eazy Plug into a propagator.
        Close the lid of the propagator and shut any present air vents to keep the humidity inside the system.
        
        Step 6: Remoistening and fresh air
        Only remoisten the Eazy Plug after 3 days and keep on doing that every 3 days until the first appearance of roots.
        Briefly open the propagator every day for a little fresh air.
        Open the air vents slightly at the earliest after 4-5 days. Humidity should remain above 80%, as too much loss of humidity can seriously effect your success rate.
        
        Step 7: Assure drainage of excess water
        Make sure Eazy Plug is able to drain excess water at all times, so it can always self-regulate the correct amount of moisture. 
        Never let the bottom of the Eazy Plug touch water, as the moisture absorption of Eazy Plug is exceptionally good and the Eazy Plug will quickly become too wet, which will have a negative effect on the rate of success.
        
        Step 8: Open air vents
        After the first roots have developed, you can gradually open the air vents further in order to acclimate the cutting to a less humid environment.
        
        Step 9: Transplant
        In 7-9 days from start your cutting should have grown its roots throughout the Eazy Plug and it is time to transplant them.
        
        Conditions for developing roots:
        1. Temperature: The optimum soil temperature for striking roots is 22º Celsius. Above 23º Celsius, you must consider a rise in failure rate.
        2. RH (humidity): RH of 80-95% is perfect. As the cutting needs its energy for striking roots, the moisture level of leaves and stem should remain intact.
        3. Light: In the first few days the cutting will form callus, from which the roots will start to grow. In this phase the cutting only needs tempered light with a broad spectrum (regular assimilation light). 
        After the development of roots the amount of light can be gradually increased.`
